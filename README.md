# crypto-eink
This is a display "driver" for my pi0. Very WIP, currently rewriting in Go. Posted here just for reference, this is deprecated and will be replaced soon.

This was intended to be used as a passive display to check crypto but the rewrite will make it faster and also make use of the buttons for multiple functions
# Usage
Copy all files to `/home/pi/driver/` on your pi

Rum `run.sh` or set it to run on boot
